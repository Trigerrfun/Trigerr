    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 24, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Trigerr.fun</strong>! We are committed to providing a fun and distraction-free gaming experience. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle information when you use our website.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We DO NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>At Trigerr.fun, our core principle is to offer <em>"Zero Distractions"</em> and focus on <em>"pure fun"</em> with <em>"No installations, no sign-ups"</em>. Therefore, we want to be clear:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Personal Accounts:</strong> We do not offer user accounts, nor do we require you to sign up or log in to play our games.</li>
      <li><strong>No Direct Personal Information Collection:</strong> We do not directly collect any personally identifiable information from you, such as your name, email address, IP address, or other data that could identify you.</li>
      <li><strong>No Tracking of Individual Game Play:</strong> We do not track your individual gameplay sessions, scores, or progress within the games.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Information You May Voluntarily Provide (Newsletter)</h2>
    <p>The only instance where you might provide information to us is if you choose to subscribe to our newsletter to <em>"Get Notified About New Games"</em>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> If you subscribe, you will voluntarily provide your email address. This will be used solely to send you updates about new free-to-play web games released on Trigerr.fun.</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of collecting your email address for the newsletter is to inform you about new content available on our site.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time by following the instructions provided in the newsletter emails.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Analytics (Potential Future Use):</strong> While we currently do not employ detailed analytics that collect personal data, we may use basic, aggregated, and anonymized analytics services (e.g., website traffic, popular games) in the future to understand overall site performance and improve user experience. These services would not collect personally identifiable information.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Media Links:</strong> Our footer includes links to external social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Discord). Clicking these will take you to those third-party websites, which have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review their policies. We are not responsible for their privacy practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
    <p>Currently, Trigerr.fun does not use cookies to track personal information or user behavior. Third-party services (such as social media platforms or embedded content) might use cookies, and their use would be governed by their respective privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal information (beyond optional newsletter emails), the risks associated with data breaches are significantly minimized. We strive to maintain the security of our website to protect against unauthorized access.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Trigerr.fun is intended for a general audience and is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us (though our site is designed not to collect it).</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. The updated policy will be posted here with a revised "Last Updated" date.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our practices, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:asktrigerr@gmail.com">asktrigerr@gmail.com</a></p>
